GoStones
----------------

Initially, I had noticed that there are a lot of packages
for Go. They were all nice and dandy but then I realized 
that gettign those packages takes a long time and some
times it's just nicer to have something do all the heavy
lifting for you. Plus I really liked Ruby's system of 
just "$>gem install unicorn" to install gems and then
they were instantly available. I believe that particular
advantage to the ease of use of Ruby and Gems really 
pushed Ruby forward. So in my desire to push Go forward
I have started this small project. Hope it's useful!
